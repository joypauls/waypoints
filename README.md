A minimal metadata+logging+dev toolkit library based on structlog.


## Dev Notes

Goals:
- Ability to specify arbitrary handlers and sinks
- Decorators for
- Want something lightweight without prescribing too much

Motivating Problems:
- Logging progress of long-running programs
- Often want to log something and save the data
- During R&D metadata sinks might change several times

Questions:
- Does mlflow handle all of this already?
  - If so, is there any value in something more focused?
- What are the initial target use cases?
